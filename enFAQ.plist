<key>1. Can I report a problem in my city?</key>
<string>Yes, you can send reports to any city or institution. If your city or institution is registered in the platform,  the city official will provide you with a direct feedback. If they aren’t registered, your report will be legally formed and sent to the institution responsible for fixing the problem. Any institution can start using the “Citizens” platform and thus remove bureaucracy and increase the transparency and productivity.</string>
<key>2. My report isn’t related to any of the given categories. May I report another signal for …? </key>
<string>Yes, you can send reports for any problem is your city, no matter whether it is part of the preselected categories. Simply select “Other signal”</string>
<key>3. How to shoot the problem in a correct way in order the report to be valid?</key>
<string>The pictures must show clearly what the problem is. The more the pictures, the clearer the report. The clearer the report, the faster the solution will come. In the platform, you can upload up to 5 pictures, also you can upload videos from your phone’s camera or add links to YouTube (only in the web portal) When you report traffic violations, the most important thing is the license plate to and the violation to be clearly visible. The best case is to have a panoramic picture, and one closer to the car in order the violation, the place and the license plate to be visible.</string>
<key>4. How is the “Citizens” app funded?</key>
<string>We’ve financed the entire platform by ourselves during the first two years. 
Fleet monitoring 
Based on the many reports of company cars shot in a violation, we created the car monitoring service. The companies are using it for internal control on their drivers’ behavior on the road. A company can upload or provide us with the license plates of its vehicles. If someone takes a picture of one of those cars in violation, an email and push notification is sent to a selected representative of the company. This is a business service that directly improves the drivers’ behavior on the road and thus betters our society.  
Insurance companies 
The signals in “Citizens”can serve as a benchmark on how risky is a certain driver. There are cars in the platform, that have been reported 10 or more times for traffic violations, which clearly indicates that these drivers are riskier than normal. When the insurance companies have such an information they can refuse or offer a higher price to such riskier drivers. “Citizens” provides a risk management tool that can provide to the insurers the info needed for determining the right premiums.
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) за Общини и други институции/ SaaS for municipalities and institutions 
After working closely with institutions for the last 2 years, we’ve noticed the following problems - sometimes it takes more than a month for a certain report to reach the person responsible. The report passes through different systems and departments, there’s a lot of paperwork and parcel services are used. Additionally, during the process no one has real time visibility and access to check where is the signal currently and what is its status which leads to high costs and low productivity. Gradually, a solution to these problems was developed. A solution that removes entirely the paperwork. One that provides full transparency and improves tenfold the productivity of the people working with it. The inspectors can update the status of any signal with a single click and can directly communicate with the sender of the report. The mayors and the higher officials can see who is working on what and  how much time is needed for a solution to be provided. Moreover, the mayors can see what are the most frequent problems and thus plan their budgets. Furthermore, this tool provides the institutions with the ability to send targeted push notifications based on location for things like road blockages, power supply shortages, events, etc.</string>

Only the officials using the platform who are responsible for the signals to be solved  see the names and phones of the people that send the reports because sometimes additional information is needed.</string> 
<key>31. Is it worthed to report a problem that is not in the predefined categories in the platform and for the solution of which, the officials are not using the “Citizens” platform.</key> 
<string>Yes! You can report any type of problems.

Finally, from the “Profile”page you can sign out</string>
<key>33. What is the meaning behind the “Apology Button”?</key> 
<string>We all make mistakes. The “Apology Button” allows the violators to send a sincere apology to the one who reported them. As we state in our mission statement - to promote and empower responsible, proactive and polite citizenship, this button plays its role in the polite part. With this button we promote the positive dialog. If the apology is accepted by the one who shot the violation, the picture is automatically removed. If the apology is not accepted the report stays. If you’ve sent an apology but there is no reaction 48 hours later, please contact us at contacts@citizens.care</string> 
<key>34. What happens if you’ve sent your report to the traffic police or other institution and you receive an apology?</key> 
<string>The apology and the report being sent to an institution are two separate things that have no correlation. Many people are writing to us to take back their reports that have already been sent to the penalizing institution after an apology is received. Unfortunately, we can’t stop the penalty once the signal is sent to the officials responsible for issuing a fine.</string>

<key>39. What is the meaning behind the statuses of the signals?</key>

<key>Как се финансира платформата &quot;Гражданите&quot;?</key>
<string>Повече от 2 г. екипът се финансираше ежемесечно с лични средства, за да може “Гражданите” да функционира.

- Мониторинг на фирмени автомобили
На база генерираните сигнали за пътни нарушения хора и фирми започнаха да използват опцията за извинение. Така създадохме услугата “Мониторинг на фирмени автомобили”, която е уникална и фирмите я използват за вътрешен контрол над водачите си. Това е бизнес услуга със социална насоченост, която фирми с изразена социална отговорност използват, за да подобрявят кутлурата на пътя в бизнес средата си.

- Авто-застрахователи
Сигналите за пътни нарушения в “Гражданите” са отправна точка за това колко е рисков един автомобил. В платформата има автомобили, които са заснети в нарушение над 10 пъти и това е индикатор, че техните водачи са по-рискови от останалите участници в движението по пътищата. Когато авто-застрахователите разполагат с подобна информация, те могат да откажат или предложат по-висока цена на услугите, които предлагат. Платформата &quot;Гражданите&quot; предлага &quot;Риск Мениджмънт&quot; инструмент на застрахователните компании, чрез който могат да бъдат определяни премиите на водачите на МПС-та.

- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) за Общини и други институции
След повече от 2 години работа с представители на институции, видяхме следните проблеми: сигналите изминават дълъг път (до 2 месеца) от подател до правилния човек в конкретната институция през системи, през различни отдели, ползва се хартия, куриерски услуги и др. Освен това никой по веригата няма достъп в реално време до това какъв е прогресът на сигнала и това води до неефективен и скъпоструващ процес. Стъпка по стъпка се роди решение за получаване и обработка на граждански сигнали за институции. Дигитализирахме и отворихме процеса за гражданите, премахнахме куриерите и хартията. Сигналът пристига при точния човек за секунди, всички отдели от институцията имат достъп в реално време до прогреса на сигнала, а ръководството на институцията има достъп до панел, който показва кой служител над какво работи. Също така решението включва и известия, чрез които институциите могат да известяват гражданите за различни събития.</string>
	<key>Как да снимам правилно проблем, за да е валиден сигналът?</key>
	<string>Колкото по-ясно е заснет даден проблем и колкото повече снимки има, толкова по-лесно и бързо ще бъде разрешен. В приложението &quot;Гражданите&quot;, можете да заснемете до 5 снимки, както и да прикачите видео чрез линк от YouTube. Когато изпращате сигнали за пътно нарушение и неправилно паркиране, е важно нарушението и регистрационният номер на МПС-то да бъдат видими на снимките или видеото.</string>
	<key>Моят сигнал не попада в нито една от изписаните категории. Мога ли да подам сигнал за ...?</key>
	<string>Да, можете да подадете сигнал за всеки един проблем във вашия град, независимо дали попада в някоя от предефинираните категории. Просто изберете &quot;Друг сигнал&quot;.</string>
	<key>Мога ли да подам сигнал за проблем в моя град?</key>
	<string>Да, можете да подадете сигнал за проблем във всеки град на територията на Република България! Ако вашата община е регистрирана в платформата &quot;Гражданите&quot;, отговорният служител или фирма ще получи вашия сигнал и ще може да Ви даде директна обратна връзка. Ако не е регистрирана, сигналът Ви ще бъде юридически оформен и изпратен до съответната институция по надлежния ред с покана за регистрация в при нас. Вашата община може да започне да използва платформата &quot;Гражданите&quot; за общини и институции напълно безплатно!</string>
