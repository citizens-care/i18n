    </h2>
    <h3 _ngcontent-c18="">Hello! Welcome to “Citizens” ("Citizens","we," "us" or "our"). thank you for using the platform “Citizens”. We believe
        that together we positively impact the world we all live in! </h3>
    <p _ngcontent-c18="">For any questions and suggestion, contact us at
        <strong _ngcontent-c18="">contacts@citizensapp.org</strong>
    </p>
    <p _ngcontent-c18="">Before reading the terms of service and policy it is important to understand what we do in order to become aware of why,
        how, and what we collect and process in order to get social problems solved quickly. Our vision is to enable and
        empower polite and responsible citizenship through technology and mutual accountability and responsibility. Citizens
        is a platform which provides regular citizens tools which you can use to solve social problem in the environment
        we all live in.</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c18="">We value your privacy and try to keep up with both the legal requirements and the highest ethical standards. Big part
        of the problems that you post go to institutions and authorities which process the reports because in many cases
        they are responsible for solving a certain problem you post. This means, in most countries, that institutions need
        your data or part of your personal data to do their job. Such data is but not limited to phone/cell number, names,
        email, location at the moment of the report sent, etc.</p>
    <p _ngcontent-c18="">You can always opt out from notifications but keep in mind that this would reflect in the way you solve social problems.
        If you opt out from status update notification you may miss important feedback from a responsible stakeholder. </p>
    <p _ngcontent-c18="">For us is very important to be a self-sustaining organization. We believe that providing products and services which
        have market value is the best way to operate over the long run. For this reason we use the published content to provide
        various services to institutions, companies, and other organizations. Those services are socially oriented and further
        help bettering the environment we all live in. For example, we generate a lot of reports for traffic violations which
        are done by drivers with company branded cars. We provide companies with a monitoring service with which they receive
        instant notifications when one of their cars is uploaded in “Citizens” violating the rules. By having this information
        companies can take measures within their own business environment. Thus, to impact positively traffic. We do not
        provide your personal data to those companies, but only the data regarding the traffic violation. Another service
        that we provide is a software-as-a-service for institutions in the platform. Authorities can log in and process your
        report/requests. By using it they cut cost and become more effective in solving social problems. </p>

    <ul>
        <li>1. We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason, without
            notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your Citizens account by logging into the
            Service and contacting us. If we terminate your access to the Service or you use the form detailed above to deactivate
            your account, your photos, comments, likes, friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible through
            your account (e.g., users will not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials
            and data may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).</li>
        <li>2. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately cease.</li>
        <li>3. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use ("Updated Terms") from time to time.
            Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide reasonable advance notice before
            the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on
            the Service, and that your use of the Service after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such
            other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should
            review these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be effective
            as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your
            use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any disputes arising before the effective
            date of the Updated Terms.
        </li>
        <li>4. We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</li>
        <li>5. We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</li>
        <li>6. We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts containing Content
            that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use.</li>
        <li>7. You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline. You
            agree that Citizens is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Citizens reserves the right, but
            has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users. Exercise common sense
            and your best judgment when interacting with others, including when you submit or post Content or any personal
            or other information.
        </li>
        <li>8. There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-party web sites
            or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or comments within the Service.
            The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the
            Service may also permit interactions between the Service and a third-party web site or feature, including applications
            that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example,
            the Service may include a feature that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third
            party, which may be publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically
            requires you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Citizens does
            not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly acknowledge and agree
            that Citizens is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE
            AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD PARTY.
            You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that connect the Service or
            your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application") and such Application may interact
            with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your Service profile. By using such Applications,
            you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you use an Application to share information, you are consenting
            to information about your profile on the Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally
            identifying information to be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Citizens has not itself
            provided such information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will
            hold the Citizens Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.</li>
        <li>9. You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</li>
        <li>10. We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via automated means,
            including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the result of standard search engine
            protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Citizens express consent).</li>

        <li>1. Citizens does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, you hereby
            grant to Citizens a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license
            to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to the Service's Privacy Policy, including
            but not limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5 ("Your
            Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities, including your photos,
            as described in the Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li>2. Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions, and you
            hereby agree that Citizens may place such advertising and promotions on the Service or on, about, or in conjunction
            with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without
            specific notice to you.</li>
        <li>3. You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial communications
            as such.
        </li>
        <li>4. You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or otherwise have
            the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the posting and use of your
            Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or infringe on the rights of any third party,
            including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual
            property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content
            you post on or through the Service; and (iv) you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms
            of Use in your jurisdiction.
        </li>
        <li>5. The Service contains content owned or licensed by Citizens ("Citizens"). Citizens Content is protected by copyright,
            trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between you and Citizens, Citizens owns and retains all
            rights in the Citizens Content and the Service. You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark,
            service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Citizens Content and you
            will not reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute,
            transmit, broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Citizens Content.</li>
        <li>6. The Citizens name and logo are trademarks of Citizens and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in
            part, without the prior written permission of Citizens. In addition, all page headers, custom graphics, button
            icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade dress of Citizens, and may not be copied, imitated
            or used, in whole or in part, without prior written permission from Citizens.</li>
        <li>7. Although it is Citizens’ intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions
            when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for
            emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also, Citizens reserves the
            right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service
            may continue to be stored by Citizens, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations,
            but may not be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Citizens encourages you to maintain your
            own backup of your Content. In other words, Citizens is not a backup service and you agree that you will not
            rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Citizens will not be liable to you for any
            modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content. You also acknowledge
            that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that the submission of Content or other information
            may not be secure.
        </li>
        <li>8. You agree that Citizens is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the Service. Citizens
            does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content. If your Content violates these
            Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.
        </li>
        <li>9. Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, as between you and Citizens, any Content will be
            non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You acknowledge
            and agree that your relationship with Citizens is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship,
            and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Citizens in a position that is any different from
            the position held by members of the general public, including with regard to your Content. None of your Content
            will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Citizens, and Citizens will not be liable for
            any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.</li>
        <li>10. It is Citizens’ policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials
            other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms, conditions and requirements
            may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are similar to those we have developed or are
            developing independently. Accordingly, Citizens does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no
            responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content,
            information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that Citizens is free to use any such
            content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without
            limitation, developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.</li>

        Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Citizens intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade
        dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); (2) violations of the API Terms; or (3) violations of
        provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that all disputes between you and
        Citizens (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with Citizens, including
        without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or
        publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules
        for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Citizens hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative,
        you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You
        may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Citizens will participate in a class action or class-wide
        arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private
        attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Citizens
        is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
        In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred
        and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Citizens or you can elect to have the arbitration administered
        instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may
        be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator
        will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.
    </p>
    <p _ngcontent-c18="">
        You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Citizens can require the other to participate
        in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Citizens in writing within 30 days of the date that you
        first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out:
    </p>
    <p _ngcontent-c18="">
        You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Citizens account, and a clear statement
        that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims
        brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language
        in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your

        to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON
        CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating
        to the arbitration provision of these Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate,
        you agree to resolve any dispute you have with Citizens exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa
        Clara, California, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the
        purpose of litigating all such disputes.

    <p _ngcontent-c18="">
        If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or
        by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will

        If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement
        on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Citizens and governs
        your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Citizens. You will not assign the Terms
        of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by
        operation of law, without the prior written consent of Citizens. Any purported assignment or delegation by you without
        the appropriate prior written consent of Citizens will be null and void. Citizens may assign these Terms of Use or
        any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent
        jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed
        severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions,
        and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between
        the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party
        beneficiary rights.
